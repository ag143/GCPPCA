## Firestore

To create a Firestore database using Terraform, you can use the google_firestore_database resource. Here is an example of how to set it up:

```
provider "google" {
  credentials = file("credentials-file")
}

resource "google_project" "my_project" {
  name = "My Project"
  project_id = "project-id"
}

resource "google_firestore_database" "database" {
  project = google_project.my_project.project_id
  name = "(default)"
  location_id = "location"
  type = "FIRESTORE_NATIVE"
  depends_on = [google_project_service.firestore]
}
```

This code initializes a Google Cloud provider with credentials, creates a Google Cloud project, and then sets up a Firestore database within that project. The type attribute is set to FIRESTORE_NATIVE to ensure compatibility with Firebase services.

Additionally, you can manage Firestore indexes and fields using the google_firestore_index and google_firestore_field resources. For example, to create a Firestore index:
```
resource "google_firestore_index" "example_index" {
  project = google_project.my_project.project_id
  collection_id = "collectionName"
  fields {
    field_path = "fieldName"
    order = "ASCENDING"
  }
  query_scope = "COLLECTION"
}
```
This code creates a Firestore index on a specified field within a collection.

For more detailed configuration and management of Firestore resources, you can refer to the official documentation and examples provided by Google Cloud Platform and Firebase.
