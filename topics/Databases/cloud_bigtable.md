To create a Cloud Bigtable instance and table using Terraform, you can use the following code snippets:

For creating a Cloud Bigtable instance, you can use the google_bigtable_instance resource. Here’s an example:

resource "google_bigtable_instance" "demo_instance" {
  name = "demo-instance"
  deletion_protection = false
  labels = {
    "env": "demo"
  }
  cluster {
    cluster_id = "demo-instance-1"
    num_nodes = 1
    storage_type = "SSD"
  }
}
For creating a table within the Bigtable instance, you can use the google_bigtable_table resource. Here’s an example:

resource "google_bigtable_table" "demo_table" {
  name = "demo-table"
  instance_name = google_bigtable_instance.demo_instance.name
}
These examples demonstrate how to create a Bigtable instance and a table within it using Terraform. The google_bigtable_instance resource is used to define the instance, and the google_bigtable_table resource is used to define the table within the instance.

Additionally, you can customize the instance and table configurations according to your needs. For instance, you can set the deletion_protection to false if you want to allow Terraform to destroy the instance.

You can also add column families to your table by specifying them within the google_bigtable_table resource
