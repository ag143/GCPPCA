Terraform can be used to manage BigQuery datasets and tables through configuration files. Here is an example of how to define a BigQuery dataset and table in Terraform:

module "bigquery_tables" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google"
  version = "~> 9.0"

  dataset_id                 = "foo"
  dataset_name               = "foo"
  description                = "some description"
  project_id                 = var.table_project_id
  location                   = "US"
  delete_contents_on_destroy = var.delete_contents_on_destroy
  tables                     = var.tables
  dataset_labels             = var.table_dataset_labels
}

module "bigquery_views_without_pii" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google"
  version = "~> 9.0"

  dataset_id                 = "${module.bigquery_tables.bigquery_dataset.dataset_id}_view_without_pii" # this creates a dependency so that we have the tables first
  dataset_name               = "foo view"
  description                = "some description"
  project_id                 = var.view_project_id
  delete_contents_on_destroy = var.delete_contents_on_destroy
  location                   = "US"
  views                      = var.views
  dataset_labels             = var.view_dataset_labels

  access = [
    {
      role          = "roles/bigquery.dataOwner"
      special_group = "projectOwners"
    }
  ]
}
This code snippet creates a BigQuery dataset and table using the terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google module. It also creates a view without personally identifiable information (PII) and sets access control for the view.

For more detailed examples, you can refer to the official documentation and examples provided by the Terraform Google BigQuery module.
