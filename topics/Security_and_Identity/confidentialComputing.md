Terraform can be used to set up GCP Confidential Computing by configuring VMs with the necessary security policies and settings. Here is an example of how you might configure a Confidential VM using Terraform:

resource "google_compute_instance" "confidential_vm" {
  name         = "confidential-vm"
  machine_type = "n2d-standard-2"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-2004-lts"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network = "default"
    access_config {
    }
  }

  service_account {
    scopes = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
  }

  metadata = {
    "enable-oslogin" = "true"
  }

  confidential_instance_config {
    enable_confidential_compute = true
  }
}
This code snippet sets up a Confidential VM in GCP using Terraform. It specifies the machine type, zone, boot disk, network interface, service account, and enables confidential computing for the instance. For more detailed configurations and additional security policies, you can refer to the official documentation or use the org-policy module to enforce specific security constraints as described in the article on cloud security policies in GCP
