HashiCorp's Terraform provider code generation tools can be used to create Terraform resources for Google Cloud AutoML. However, as of January 23, 2024, Google Cloud AutoML Vision is deprecated and superseded by Vertex AI, which is now supported by Terraform.

For deploying Google Cloud AutoML models with Terraform, you can refer to the documentation and example scripts provided by Pulumi and GitHub user eshapoddar. These resources include Terraform scripts to automate the setup of infrastructure for an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using AutoML Vision.

Here is a basic example of how you might set up an AutoML model using Terraform:

resource "google_vertex_ai_dataset" "example" {
  dataset_id   = "example-dataset"
  display_name = "Example Dataset"
  metadata_schema_uri = "gs://google-cloud-aiplatform/schema/dataset/metadata/image_1234.json"
  labels = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
  # Add other necessary configurations here
}

resource "google_vertex_ai_model" "example" {
  display_name = "Example Model"
  # Add other necessary configurations here
}
This script assumes that you have the necessary Google Cloud SDK and Terraform installed and configured locally to authenticate with GCP and execute the Terraform scripts.

For detailed instructions and customization, you should refer to the specific documentation and scripts provided by Pulumi and eshapoddar, which include setting up variables and running commands like terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply
