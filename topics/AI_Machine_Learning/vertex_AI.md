Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool that you can use to provision resources and permissions for multiple Google Cloud services, including Vertex AI.
 Terraform has a declarative and configuration-oriented syntax, which you can use to describe the infrastructure that you want to provision in your Vertex AI project.

The following are some Terraform resources available for Vertex AI products and services:

google_notebooks_environment: Represents a Vertex AI Workbench environment.
