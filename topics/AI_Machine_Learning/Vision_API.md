Terraform can be used to build infrastructure that integrates with vision APIs, such as the one described in a Medium article where a web app for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) vision service is built using Terraform scripts.
 The script sets up a web application that uses the mobile camera to take pictures, analyzes the content with the vision service, and stores details in an autonomous JSON database.

Additionally, the Reddit community discusses using AI tools like CodeGPT Vision to generate Terraform scripts, though it is noted that the generated scripts may not be valid or fully functional.

For visualizing your Terraform code, tools like Terravision can help create professional cloud architecture diagrams from your Terraform code automatically, supporting AWS, Google, and Azure
