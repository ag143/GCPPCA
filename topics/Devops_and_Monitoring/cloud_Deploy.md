To deploy an application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform, you can follow these steps:

Set up the Google Cloud provider:
provider "google" {
  project     = "your-gcp-project-id"
  region      = "us-central1"
  credentials = file("path/to/your/service-account-file.json")
}
Define the Cloud Run service:
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "run_service" {
  name = "your_app"
  location = "us-europe-west1"
  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "registry.com/path/to/your/app:1"
      }
    }
  }
}
Enable the Cloud Run API:
resource "google_project_service" "run_api" {
  service = "run.googleapis.com"
  disable_on_destroy = true
}
Ensure dependencies:
depends_on = [google_project_service.run_api]
After setting up the configuration, you can test the configuration and apply it using the following commands:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
This process will deploy your application to Google Cloud Run
