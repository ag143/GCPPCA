Terraform can be used to manage Google Cloud Platform (GCP) monitoring resources such as datasets, monitors, and dashboards. The terraform-observe-google-cloud-monitoring module by Observe Inc. is designed for this purpose.

To manage alerting policies in GCP using Terraform, you can define resources like google_monitoring_alert_policy in your configuration file. For example, an alerting policy that monitors CPU usage can be defined as follows
 :

resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "alert_policy" {
  display_name = "CPU Utilization > 50%"
  documentation {
    content = "The ${metric.display_name} of the ${resource.type} ${resource.label.instance_id} in ${resource.project} has exceeded 50% for over 1 minute."
  }
  combiner = "OR"
  conditions {
    display_name = "Condition 1"
    condition_threshold {
      comparison = "COMPARISON_GT"
      duration = "60s"
      filter = "resource.type = \"gce_instance\" AND metric.type = \"compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization\""
      threshold_value = "0.5"
      trigger {
        count = "1"
      }
    }
  }

  alert_strategy {
    notification_channel_strategy {
      renotify_interval = "1800s"
      notification_channel_names = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.email.name]
    }
  }

  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.email.name]

  user_labels = {
    severity = "warning"
  }
}
This configuration defines an alerting policy that sends a notification when the CPU utilization of a VM instance is greater than 50% for over one minute, with repeated notifications sent every 30 minutes.

Additionally, the terraform-google-slo module can be used to create Service Level Objectives (SLOs) on Google Cloud from custom Stackdriver metrics. An example configuration for an SLO is provided below
 :

module "slo_basic" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/slo/google//modules/slo-native"
  config = {
    project_id        = var.app_engine_project_id
    service           = data.google_monitoring_app_engine_service.default.service_id
    slo_id            = "gae-slo"
    display_name      = "90% of App Engine default service HTTP response latencies < 500ms over a day"
    goal              = 0.9
    calendar_period   = "DAY"
    type              = "basic_sli"
    method            = "latency"
    latency_threshold = "0.5s"
  }
}
This configuration sets up an SLO that monitors HTTP response latencies for an App Engine service, with a goal of 90% of responses being under 500ms over a day.
