Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool that allows you to provision and manage cloud infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) including Cloud Build resources. To use Terraform with Cloud Build, you first need to write a configuration file, typically named main.tf, where you describe the infrastructure you want to provision. This file includes resources such as networks, compute instances, and Cloud Build resources.

For Cloud Build, Terraform provides specific resources to manage Cloud Build connections, triggers, and worker pools. For example, you can use the google_cloudbuild_trigger resource to define a build trigger.

Here is a basic example of a Terraform configuration file for a Cloud Build trigger:

resource "google_cloudbuild_trigger" "example" {
  name     = "example-trigger"
  project  = "your-gcp-project-id"
  repo_name = "your-repo-name"
  branch_input {
    branch_name = "main"
  }
  build {
    steps {
      name = "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud"
      args = ["app", "deploy"]
    }
  }
}
This configuration sets up a trigger that will automatically run a build whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the specified repository. The build step deploys an application using gcloud app deploy.

To apply this configuration, you would run the following commands:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
These commands initialize the Terraform configuration, generate an execution plan, and then apply the plan to create the Cloud Build trigger.

Additionally, you can use Terraform to manage other Cloud Build resources such as connections and worker pools. For example, the google_cloudbuildv2_connection resource can be used to manage connections to source repositories.
